CHAPTER 7

Exercise 1  
Consider the following methods:

public static void main(String[] args) {
    loop(10);
}

public static void loop(int n) {
    int i = n;
    while (i > 1) {
        System.out.println(i);
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            i = i / 2;
        } else {
            i = i + 1;
        }
    }
}

1. Draw a table that shows the value of the variables i and n during the execution of loop. The table should contain one column for each variable and one line for each iteration.
     i     n
0   10     10
1    5     10
2    6     10
3    3     10
4    4     10
5    2     10

2. What is the output of this program?

The output of the program is:
10
5
6
3
4
2

3. Can you prove that this loop terminates for any positive value of n?

The calculations inside the loop will always make any positive value of n become 1, and at that point, it terminates the loop.
