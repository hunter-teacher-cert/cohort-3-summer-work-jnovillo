CHAPTER 8

Exercise 2
 The purpose of this exercise is to practice reading code and recognizing the traversal patterns in this chapter. The following methods are hard to read, because instead of using meaningful names for the variables and methods, they use names of fruit.
For each method, write one sentence that describes what the method does, without getting into the details of how it works. For each variable, identify the role it plays.

Calculates the result of multiplying all elements in `a`
// Multiplies all elements in array a and returns the product
public static int banana(int[] a) {
    // Stores the multiplication product
    int kiwi = 1;
    // Array's index
    int i = 0;
    while (i < a.length) {
        kiwi = kiwi * a[i];
        i++;
    }
    return kiwi;
}

// Finds the index ot the first item in the array a that is equal to the int variable grape
public static int grapefruit(int[] a, int grape) {
    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        if (a[i] == grape) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

// Counts how many times is apple inside the array a
public static int pineapple(int[] a, int apple) {
    // Stores the number of apples inside the array
    int pear = 0;
    for (int pine: a) {
        if (pine == apple) {
            pear++;
        }
    }
    return pear;
}
