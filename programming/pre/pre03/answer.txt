Chapter 4 - Exercise 1 

The point of this exercise is to practice reading code and to make sure that you understand the flow of execution through a program with multiple methods.

1. What is the output of the following program? Be precise about where there are spaces and where there are newlines.
Hint: Start by describing in words what ping and baffle do when they are invoked.

The output of the program is:
No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.

Method ping prints a period (.) and add a new line after the text.
Method baffle prints "wug", it does not add a new line, and it calls method ping.

2. Draw a stack diagram that shows the state of the program the first time ping is invoked.

main[]
zoop[]
baffle[]
ping[]

3. What happens if you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method? (We will see why in the next chapter.)

It creates an infinite recursion.
